Security aspect, this system is very important for account security, do not know the password is unable to login system, even if someone knows your system's website link.

For the maintenance and upgrade of the system, it is important to have many functions that are beneficial to the maintenance of the system. 

JSP is more conducive to system maintenance and upgrade than PHP. 

The JSP code, on the other hand, is compiled into servlets and executed by the Java Virtual Machine only on the first request to the JSP page.Therefore, JSP is generally considered to be more efficient than PHP. JSP is a server-side scripting language, the biggest advantage is high development efficiency and MVC architecture, can support highly complex Web-based large applications. From the point of view of security, PHP program is more open, and JAVA development of JSP is more secure. 

Finally, PHP is better than JSP from a development perspective.But from the point of view of maintenance system and upgrade, JSP object-oriented good, maintainability is high.But JSP is more expensive than PHP.
